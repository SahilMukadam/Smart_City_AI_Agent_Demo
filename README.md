# 🏙️ Smart City AI Agent

![Smart City AI Agent Workflow](./docs/images/Smart_City_AI_Agent_Banner.png)

An autonomous AI agent that answers questions about London city conditions by intelligently querying multiple real-time data sources, correlating patterns, detecting anomalies, and generating insightful analysis.

**Ask about any location in London** — streets, areas, landmarks — and the agent autonomously decides which APIs to call, fetches data in parallel, detects correlations (e.g., rain causing congestion), flags anomalies, and responds with a structured analysis.

## ✨ Key Features

### Autonomous Agent
- **LangGraph state machine** with 7-node reasoning pipeline
- **Parallel tool execution** — calls multiple APIs simultaneously via ThreadPoolExecutor
- **Conditional routing** — greetings skip the tool pipeline entirely
- **Conversation memory** — session-based context for follow-up questions
- **Argument extraction with geocoding** — resolves any London address to coordinates via Nominatim

### Intelligence Layer
- **Correlation engine** — cross-analyzes traffic × weather × air quality patterns
- **Anomaly detection** — threshold-based alerts (🚨 critical, ⚠️ warning, ℹ️ info)
- **City health score** — composite 0–100 score across traffic, tube, weather, air quality
- **Proactive insights** — endpoint that generates a full city report without a user question

### Real-Time Data Sources
| Source | API | Data |
|--------|-----|------|
| Transport for London | TfL API (free) | Tube status, road disruptions, road corridors |
| Weather | Open-Meteo (free) | Temperature, rain, wind, humidity, forecast |
| Air Quality | OpenAQ (free) | PM2.5, PM10, NO₂ readings with AQI |
| Traffic Flow | TomTom (free tier) | Real-time speed, congestion ratios, incidents |
| Geocoding | Nominatim/OSM (free) | Any London address → coordinates |

### Frontend Dashboard
- **Split-view layout** — chat (left) + live map & insights (right)
- **Live reasoning chain** — watch the agent think step-by-step as it processes
- **TomTom traffic flow tiles** — red/yellow/green overlay on the map
- **Health gauge** — Plotly gauge with per-category sub-scores
- **Anomaly alert cards** — color-coded with recommendations
- **Glassmorphism UI** — dark theme with blur effects

## 💡 Example Queries

| Query | What the Agent Does |
|-------|-------------------|
| "How's the tube today?" | Checks all Underground line statuses |
| "Traffic near Baker Street" | Geocodes Baker Street → fetches TomTom flow data |
| "Why is traffic bad? Check weather too" | Calls traffic + weather + disruptions, correlates rain with congestion |
| "Compare traffic Canary Wharf vs City" | Parallel flow checks at both locations with comparison |
| "Full London overview" | All data sources + correlations + anomalies + health score |
| "Is it safe to run outside?" | Air quality check with health recommendation |
| "Will it rain in 6 hours?" | Weather forecast analysis |

## 📖 Portfolio Narrative

> I started with ML-based traffic congestion prediction in my MSc Digital Twin project, then evolved the concept into an **autonomous AI agent** that integrates multiple city data sources in real-time.

This project demonstrates:

1. **AI Agent Architecture** — LangGraph state machine with conditional routing, parallel execution, and conversation memory
2. **System Design** — Clean separation of data layer (tool wrappers), intelligence layer (correlation + anomaly detection), and presentation layer (Streamlit)
3. **Production Patterns** — Response caching, graceful degradation, structured error handling, comprehensive testing (250+ tests)
4. **Data Engineering** — Multi-source data ingestion, standardized schemas, cross-source correlation
5. **Full-Stack Development** — FastAPI backend + Streamlit frontend with real-time UX (live reasoning chain, traffic map tiles)
